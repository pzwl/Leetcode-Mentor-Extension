# Creating Icons for the Extension

You need to create 3 icon files for the extension:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (shown in extension management page)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (shown in extension management page)  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (used in Chrome Web Store)

## Design Suggestions:
- Use a robot/AI theme ü§ñ
- Include coding elements like {} or </> 
- Use colors that match the LeetCode theme (orange/blue)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Tools to Create Icons:
1. **Canva** - has preset icon templates
2. **Figma** - free design tool
3. **GIMP** - free image editor
4. **Online Icon Generators** - search for "favicon generator"

## Quick Option:
You can use emoji-based icons as a temporary solution:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/
2. Search for "robot" ü§ñ or "gear" ‚öôÔ∏è
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
5. Place them in the `icons/` folder

The extension will work without icons, but they make it look more professional!
